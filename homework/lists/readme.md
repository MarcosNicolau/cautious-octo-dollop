# Linked Lists homework

Hi there, this homework is about linked lists, you can check the exercise [here](./exercise.md)

It consists of three exercises, and I took the freedom to build a simple header file that contains classes for an easier interaction with the lists.

## How to run the files

I made a simple cli program to run the exercises, just give it permission by running

```bash
chmod +x ./compile.sh
```

And then run:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

You will be prompt to enter the exercise number, either 1, 2 or 3.
