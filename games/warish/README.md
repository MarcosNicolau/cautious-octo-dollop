# WARISH

Warish is a RPG terminal based game, where you start out as a random family who wants to survive the country's civil war.

## What is it about?

You start out as a completely random family which wants to survive the civil war occurring in the country. For that, you will have to upgrade your house, trade and take care of your family. Then, in the night you'll choose a member of the family to go raiding and collect materials, food, medicine, ammunition, etc. Also, don't remember to leave someone of the family guarding the house...

The game is not easy, all sort of random events can occur, where you'll have to decide what do you stand for: morality or survival?. Would allow someone you don't know live with you? If you had your child kidnapped on exchange of goods, would you save him?

Each game is completely different from one another, because the world, events and characters are all randomly created.

### Disclaimer

The game is being developed by one developer on its free time so there is no near launch date.
