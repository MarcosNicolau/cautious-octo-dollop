# A big c++ Collection

Hi there, this repo contains all the homeworks and assignments for the data structure and algorithms class at UTN.FRBA

Not only that, but I'm also uploading some personal project I made using c++ for fun!

## BIG DISCLAIMER

If you are a random guy who happens to be in the same class I am or was, DO NOT expect it to be right. Having said that, please make use of this material as you wish.
