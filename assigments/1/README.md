# C++ TP.1

Hi there, this is the first mandatory assignment for the data structures and algorithms class at UTN.FRBA

### I made some changes

I took the freedom to add a simple menu that let's you choose between the different items of the assignment.

## Run the program

If you are on linux, then I made things easy for you, just give access to the `compile.sh` file by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ./compile.sh
```

And then run:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

And that's that.
